# 1g of Code — Branding & Design System

## Aesthetic

**"Workshop Workbench"** — the feeling of a maker's space at night. A warm pool of light on a dark surface, the glow of a terminal cursor, the smell of solder and sawdust. Exposed craft meeting modern tooling.

The site should feel built, not generated. Tactile, not slick. There's a deliberate analog warmth here — the grain texture, the cream-not-white text, the amber that reads more like a lit filament than a UI button. Everything should feel like something a thoughtful person chose, not a default.

The show is about the magic of building things in public, where the barrier to creating software is rapidly collapsing. That ethos should show up in the aesthetic: approachable, curious, hands-on. Not corporate. Not hype. More like: someone's really into this, and they want you to be too.

Typography reinforces the duality — Bricolage Grotesque is bold and editorial for headlines, the kind of type that makes a statement. IBM Plex Mono is technical and readable for everything else, a nod to the terminal roots of software craft. Together they feel hand-picked, not defaulted into.

The dark mode is primary. The light mode should feel like the same space with the workshop lights fully on — warmer paper tones, not stark white.
